# MAPF Framework ‚Äî Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent Path Finding

This repository contains my research work at the ACT Lab (USC Viterbi School of Engineering), where I developed a decentralized Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) framework using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize collision-free navigation for teams of autonomous agents operating in obstacle-dense environments.

MAPF is an NP-hard problem with growing relevance to real-world robotics, warehouse logistics, and multi-robot coordination. This project explores the application of deep reinforcement learning to overcome scalability challenges found in traditional MAPF solvers.
