# RL for MAPF 


Training:
  * modify train.py to create the desired environment in main
  * Training works best on small environments/few agents
  * use tensorboard to view results


Experiments:
  * Create experiments with different environments in experiments.py
  * Choose a variable to vary (agents, obstacles, size, etc.) and run trials for that environment
  * Collect results and make graphs
